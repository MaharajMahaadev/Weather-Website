# Introduction
The Weather Website project aims to deliver an intuitive and visually appealing web interface for accessing comprehensive weather information. By leveraging various weather APIs and implementing responsive design principles, we strive to create an immersive user experience for accessing weather reports.

# Features
The Weather Website aims to offer the following features:

- **Air Quality:** Provides information about the air quality index (AQI) and related metrics to keep users informed about the current air conditions.
- **Wind:** Displays real-time wind speed and direction to give users a sense of the atmospheric conditions.
- **Sun:** Provides sunrise and sunset times, ensuring users can plan their activities accordingly.
- **UV Index:** Offers UV index readings to help users understand the level of UV radiation and take necessary precautions.
- **Rain Chance:** Indicates the probability of rain, allowing users to plan their outdoor activities effectively.
- **7-Day Forecast:** Provides a comprehensive 7-day weather forecast, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions for each day.
Please note that these features are subject to change and further enhancements as the project evolves.
